# Experiment Automation

Pinpoint and Ephys Link can work together to automate manual procedures in electrophysiology experiments. Follow the
[instructions on Pinpoint's documentation](https://virtualbrainlab.org//pinpoint/tutorials/tutorial_ephys_copilot.html)
to use automation in your next experiment!

**Note:** Automation is still in early development. We
recommend [contacting](https://virtualbrainlab.org/about/overview.html) Dan Birman and Kenneth Yang if you would like to
try it out!
