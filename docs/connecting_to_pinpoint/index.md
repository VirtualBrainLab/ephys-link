# Connecting to Pinpoint

[Pinpoint](https://github.com/VirtualBrainLab/Pinpoint) is a tool for planning electrophysiology recordings and other
_in vivo_ insertions, as well as tracking the position of probes in real-time inside the brain.

Ephys Link was developed alongside Pinpoint to facilitate tracking and positioning of manipulators. Follow the
[instructions on Pinpoint's documentation](https://virtualbrainlab.org//pinpoint/tutorials/tutorial_ephys_link.html) to
use Ephys Link inside Pinpoint!
